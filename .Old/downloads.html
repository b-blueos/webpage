<h3 class="blue">Downloads:</h3>
<p>Currently there are <b>no downloads</b>, as we have yet to make a stable enough build.</p>
<p>Although, you could go to <a href="https://github.com/b-blueos">GitHub</a> and compile a build yourself... <b>(Not recommended as of now...)</b></p>
<br> <br> <br>
<h3 class="blue">Changelog:</h3>
<p><b>Upcomming versions (Ideas at least...):</b><br>
 <b>Dolphin:</b> Initial release. <br>
 <b>Sea:</b> Supposed to have an installscript so you can install it straight onto an Arch-build. <br>
 <b>Sky:</b> A UI-update... <br>
 These updates may or may not be released as they are not 100% confirmed. <br>
 Multiple of these ideas may be squashed into one update.
</p> <br> <br>

<h3 class="blue">What we hope to bring with our first release:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Blue Package Manager (Name suggestions: BPM, Blue. Language: As of now: shell/bash)</li>
  <li>A UI which is a little customized to fit the name, BlueOS. (If this is not in the first release, it'll be released later via our package manager.)</li>
  <li><b>A working automatic install script. Minimal, but will support:</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>UEFI and BIOS.</li>
    <li>Architecture: x86_64/amd64 (Only!)</li>
    <li>Multiboot and clean install.</li>
    <li>Choosing which drive is used for installation.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>[Estimated] System requirements:</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>An x86_64 (amd64) processor.</li>
    <li>4 GB of RAM</li>
    <li>32 GB disk space available. (Although 64 GB is recommended.)</li>
    <li>Time...</li>
    <li>A USB-drive to use as installation media.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
