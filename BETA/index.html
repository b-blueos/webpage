    <h3 class="blue">What is BlueOS?</h3>
    <p><b class="blueD">BlueOS is an Operative System based on <a href="archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>.
       It is a spare-time hobby-project made by some developer with too much free time.
       We hope to have our first release of the OS in the automn of 2019. </b> <br>
       We will release almost every part of the project under the GPL V.3 License,
       as this project strive for an internet society which can offer software and Operative Systems for free.
       If you want to collaborate please check out the <a href="jobs.html">Contribute-tab</a>. </p>
       <p><i><b class="blue">Should you use BlueOS?</b></i></p>
       <p>Well, it depends. If you want 100% complete control of what gets installed on your system, then BlueOS is nothing for you.
         BlueOS is for people who wants a simple distrubution, it is based on Arch, which has the rumor of being har to install,
         but not to worry! As BlueOS has an automatic script to install the OS without hassle.
