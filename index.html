          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            BlueOS is a linux distribution based on <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux<span>Arch Linux is a Linux distro using a rolling release schedule. (Click for more info.)</span></a>. <br><br>
            It is a spare time, hobby, project I am working on, and then mostly for the learning experience! <br><br>
            Right now I, BurnyLlama, is the only one working on this project, but another developer known as Gochady has said he's interested in the project and
            will probably start working on it too. And together we hope to bring the first release of BlueOS sometime during <a>Q4<span>The last quarter of the year, October, November and December.</span></a> this year (2019). <br><br>
            This project will be released under the GPL V3 License, as the nature of linux is free and open source software, which we will strive to keep up!
          </p>
          <h2>Should you use BlueOS?</h2>
          <p>
            Probably not, not yet at least, as BlueOS is not yet done enough. But when it is done you <b>could</b> use it.
            As of now it is hard to state if there will be any special features in BlueOS... Although we will strive to make BlueOS as customizable as possible, but still leave
            it as unbloated as possible. As we shall believe in choice!
            It will include install scripts for Arch Linux which would make an easier/"less worky" way.
          </p>
          <h2>Gallery</h2>
          <p>Here are some screenshots from the early versions of BlueOS. <br> <i>(Hover the images for larger view.)</i> </p>

            <h2>Can you install straight onto a current installtion of Arch Linux?</h2>
            <p>We hope to bring that feature in the first release.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h2>From where did the idea originate?</h2>
            <p>It originated during the spring of 2019, while BurnyLlama was bored and started working a bit on this project. After that the idea was kind of put on the shelf during the summer.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h2>What platforms will BlueOS support?</h2>
            <p>
              BlueOS will mostly support UEFI systems, but I will try to make it able to support BIOS too.
              The UEFI installer will support multibooting, while the BIOS installer will not.
              Estimated Specifications:
              <ul>
                <li>32GB free unallocated space, while 64GB will be recommended.</li>
                <li>A USB-Drive or other media for the install media.</li>
                <li>An internet connection.</li>
                <li>And lastly, time...</li>
              </ul>
