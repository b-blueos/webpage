        <h6 class="blue">What is BlueOS?</h6>
        <p>BlueOS is my very, very, very bad customization of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>. It is mostly a learning project... <br>
          (Using the archiso package from the official repos.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <h6 class="blue">Who makes BlueOS?</h6>
        <p>BurnyLlama, me, makes BlueOS. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/BurnyLlama/blueos">GitHub</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <h6 class="blue">Who should use BlueOS?</h6>
        <p>Well... Simply put... Noone would want to use it, unless they would just like a simple way of installing Arch Linux... <br>
          (Or if they, for some reason, actually likes some features that I may add... But then again... They would all be available on GitHub and would work with any Arch installation...)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <h6 class="blue">Can BlueOS be installed as an overlay straight onto Arch? </h6>
        <p>Not yet, but I have ideas to do it. Technically BlueOS is just Arch with some overlays, so I will only have to make a script for it...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <h6 class="blue">Pre-requisites:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>32 GB storage space (Recommended, would work with less...)</li>
            <li>A USB-Drive or CD to be used as installation media...</li>
            <li>Time...</li>
            <li>An internet-connection.</li>
            <li>A UEFI-System, I am currently not supporting regular BIOS... :(</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <br> <br>
    <h3 class="blue text-center">Downloads:</h3>
    <p>Currently there are no downloads, as I have yet to make a stable enough build.</p>
    <p>Although, you could go to <a href="https://github.com/BurnyLlama/blueos">GitHub</a> and compile a beta build yourself...</p>
   <br> <br>
   <h3 class="blue text-center">Changelog:</h3>
   <p>Upcomming versions (Ideas at least...): <br>
     Sea: Supposed to have an installscript so you can install it straight onto an Arch-build. <br>
     Sky: A UI-update... <br>
     These updates may or may not be released as they are in the "thinking stage"....
   </p> <br>
